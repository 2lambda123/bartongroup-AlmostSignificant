=====

AlmostSignificant is an open-source platform for aggregating multiple sources of quality metrics as well as meta-data associated with DNA sequencing runs from Illumina sequencing machines. 
AlmostSignificant is a graphical platform to streamline the quality control of DNA sequencing data, to collect and store these data for future reference and to collect extra meta-data associated with the sequencing runs to check for errors and monitor the volume of data produced by the associated machines. 
AlmostSignificant has been used to track the quality of over 80 sequencing runs covering over 2500 samples produced over the last three years

Requires python 2.7, the illuminate package (available via pip install illuminate), and django >1.7 and pdflatex.
